              </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    <p class="blogContentPc d-none d-md-block">Before getting started with Arabic localization, it’s important to understand how Modern Standard Arabic has evolved when thinking about Arabic localization – and the history is fascinating. 
					Arabic is the fifth largest language in the world with over 400 million speakers. They’re primarily based in northern Africa and the Middle East. 
					The written form plays a big role in culture because it’s the language of the Koran (the islamic holy book) and is read by nearly two billion practising Muslims.
					The people who speak different Arabic dialects won’t necessarily understand each other, but luckily Modern Standard Arabic provides an opportunity for Arabic localization.

                      <br><br><span class="blogSubTitle">The importance of Modern Standard Arabic</span><br><br>
                      The Koran is written in Classical Arabic. You can think of Modern Standard Arabic as an expanded and modernized form of classical Arabic. MSA has an expanded vocabulary and is used in books, the media etc. 
Modern Standard Arabic is the most popular of the two writing forms and is universal in Arabic-speaking nations.
People don’t speak Modern Standard Arabic in everyday life, but it is used for formal speech. This is particularly helpful to allow the speakers of different dialects to do business.
The use of Modern Standard Arabic online has helped develop and homogenize the language. It’s the twelfth most popular language on the internet, accounting for around 1% of websites.
Media outlets like Al-Jazeera play an important role too.

                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">The development of Modern Standard Arabic’s vocabulary</span><br><br>
                      Modern Standard Arabic is important to translations because its expanded vocabulary means you can translate words that are important to apps and software. 
New words are based on components of Arabic words or adopted from European languages. For example, the Arabic word for “internet” is إنترنت, which is “internet” spelt phonetically.
However, Modern Standard Arabic may not have widely accepted terms for specialized concepts, creating issues for translators.
This has led to technical translations like صف المُطلق for “absolute zero” (the lowest temperature possible).
 صف المُطلق literally translates as “absolute row”, but has been defined by technical dictionary ARABTERM.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">Developing a termbase for Arabic translations</span><br><br>
                      Termbases record key phrases with their meaning and translation, helping create accurate and consistent translations.
We recommend creating a termbase when you start the translation and localization process.
New words are being added to Modern Standard Arabic to meet the demands of modern software and specialist applications. The answers won’t always be readily available but creating termbase entries provides an opportunity to discuss and define your approach.

                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">Getting started with localization</span><br><br>
                      Modern Standard Arabic provides a helpful base for Arabic translation. It’s widely used for writing and an important business language.
Modern Standard Arabic’s vocabulary means localization can be more difficult than other languages but it’s manageable. 
Locale can advise on your Arabic localization strategy as well as carrying out the work.

                    <p class="blogContentMobile d-md-none">If you want to tap into the Arabic market, you’ll first need to earn their attention.
                      Breaking into new markets isn’t just about having in-demand products or filling a need. Rather, much of your success will depend on how you adapt your company to their market.
                      Despite over a third of internet users being non-native English speakers, studies from Forrester Research show that website visitors will stay on a website longer if the content is in their native language.
                      Localization is the practice of making your website fit within a unique market. The language of the content, the images of the people, pop culture references, or common symbols can all provide the sense that your website was made with an audience in mind.
                      Take a look at four reasons your business should consider Arabic localization for your content marketing:
                      <br><br><span class="blogSubTitle">1. Localization Increases Sales</span><br><br>
                      User language preferences have been studied at length. The resulting figures indicate that 90% of users will opt for a website version in their native tongue, regardless of whether or not they speak English.
                      Even more telling? A whopping 42% of users say they will NEVER do business with a company if the content isn’t in their native language.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">2. Localization Offers a Competitive Advantage</span><br><br>
                      Despite the benefits of Arabic localization, your competitors may be failing to capitalize on them. When you employ content localization, it gives you an obvious advantage over businesses trying to compete for your market but have yet to adapt their content.
                      And if your competitors DO have a localized website, they’re likely the ones to earn the business if you do not. You can upgrade your own content marketing to encroach on their market share.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">3. Localization Offers a Native Appeal</span><br><br>
                      Some companies are so thorough and effective at localization that it’s something of a shock to find out they’re not actually based in your home country.
                      The more you can blend with your target country’s culture, from imagery to linguistics to the arts and more, the better chance you stand of seeming like you belong in their business world.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">4. Localization Strengthens Your Global Presence</span><br><br>
                      Even if you’re only doing business in the U.S. localization can put you in a position of <a href="Three-Tips-for-Going-Global.html" class="blogInnerLink">global prominence</a>. It’s not easy taking a business across borders, but investing in localization shows that you have the business acumen to adapt to a new market.
