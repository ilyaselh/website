                  <p>
                    <p class="blogContentPc d-none d-md-block">In general, when companies need documents translated, they usually turn to a larger agency. For organizations looking for translating their content in a lot of languages, this can be your best bet. In almost every other circumstance, however, hiring a freelance translator can be the best decision. We’ll explore why in detail below.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="blogSubTitle">More direct Communication with no misunderstandings</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Agencies adopt a workflow that makes communication more indirect. A project manager passes your request onto someone else who then hands it over to a random translator from their database. This multi-step process increases the likelihood of miscommunication. With a freelancer, nothing stops you from reaching out directly. It is easier to clarify your needs and wishes directly with the translator, and make sure you both understand each other correctly.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="blogSubTitle">Freelancers Are Almost Always Cheaper</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Translation agencies are considered middlemen in the language services industry. When you hire them, you’re paying for things like administrative staff and project management. The person doing the work often receives a small chunk of what’s on the invoice. Hiring a freelance translator directly saves you money, compensates the translator fairly while less money is wasted on administration.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="blogSubTitle">You Can Create Long-Term partnership</span>
                        <br><br>
                        That Arabic translator who worked on your agency project might not be available next time you need him. This means that someone else will have to take time to learn about your company, to study your content, and to understand your goals. Freelance translators can develop an in-depth understanding of your preferences and your target market. Why waste time retraining if you don’t have to?
                        You Make Sure That Your Project Get Done by Professional Humans – Not Machines
                        The sad truth is that many translation agencies use machine translation as a crutch to compensate for their lack of human translators. With all the grammatical inconsistencies and unnatural phrasing, machine translation can seriously hurt your intended message. Proper international and multilingual SEO requires human translation. With a freelance translator, you can make sure you get a human translator every time.

                        <span class="blogSubTitle">Freelancer Translators Can Offer a Personalized Service</span>
                        <br><br>
                        On any given day, an agency might be juggling hundreds of projects in dozens of different languages. To stop it all from blending into one big mess, they have strict workflow rules and well-defined service offerings. No one customer justifies a process change. To a freelancer, meanwhile, you’re not just another number and can get the personalized service you deserve.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="blogSubTitle">You Can Get Specialized Translators</span> 
                        <br><br>
                        While a translation agency might have a translator that specializes in medical or legal translations, you’d struggle to find anything more granular than that. Most agencies profit off of being generalists. They cast a wide net to catch the most fish. Freelance translators, on the other hand, are more specialized in a certain field. That means it’s a lot easier to find one with the exact expertise you’re looking for, and that understands your product or service completely.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="blogSubTitle">You Get more Consistency</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Agencies often have five or more translators working on a given project—even more if it’s large or urgent, and that is just simply too many cooks in the kitchen. It can make your project look like it was patched together. Word choice and tone will vary more from section to section than if one specific translator edited the whole thing. Though the editing process helps equalize the two, the switch in providers if still often very prevalent if you look for long enough.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="blogSubTitle">Increased Confidentiality</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Professional freelance translators take confidentiality seriously and have a confidentiality clause in their contracts. We are also used to signing and following Non-Disclosure Agreements. One individual freelance translator reduces the risk of leaking confidential information, no additional employees or translators get access to your information.
