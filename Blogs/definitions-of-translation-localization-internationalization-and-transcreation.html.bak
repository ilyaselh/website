              </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    <p class="blogContentPc d-none d-md-block">What makes Arabic Game Localization so important and why should it be part of your expansion and translation strategies? As the 5th most popular language with a large gaming community, the Arabic-speaking gaming market is a crucial one to tap. But the Arabic language introduces unique linguistic, cultural, and technical challenges that should be resolved effectively if you want to make a real and sustainable connection with your target locale. So, how should it be tapped and what should you keep in mind with Arabic Game Localization? Learn all about it in my blog!
                      <br><br>
					  What Does The Arabic Market Include?
					  <br><br>
                      There are 22 territories that claim Arabic as an official language, with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Egypt being the most profitable in terms of gaming revenue. The Arabic-speaking countries take up the lion share of the so-called MENA Region which includes 18 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Next to Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Turkish, and Hebrew are also spoken in this region. In this article, I will show you that the Arabic market is one of the most interesting ones in terms of game revenue, close to reaching the 6 billion mark.

                      <br><br>
					  Why The Arabic Market?
						<br><br>
						
                      Saudi Arabia is the most profitable Arabic-speaking market. It ranks at #22 by global gaming revenue and 92 percent of the gamers consider themselves gaming enthusiasts.
Mobile Games, especially puzzles, are the most popular in the Arabic-speaking market. In fact, the UAE is known as a big spender in the gaming industry with most of the money going to mobile games. Around 39% of gamers in the UAE prefer to spend on mobile games, while 33 percent prefer PC and 38 percent console. In Saudi Arabia, this number is steadily increasing from 13.4%.
Smartphone penetration has hit 46 percent in Saudi Arabia. This results in 15.5 million people. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), this number has reached 80.6 percent.

                      <br><br>
					  The Fastest Growing Online Market
					  <br><br>
                      Despite it being the MENA Region’s highest growing and most widely spoken language, only 1 percent of the content in local app stores is available in Arabic.
That 1 percent may sound like a great opportunity to claim a place among the top games available in the Arabic language. But there is more good news. Arabic is the single fastest growing online language, having grown no less than 9,348% between 2000 and 2020, beating every other language in the online top Ten. The gaming industry neatly follows this growth, increasing the demand for quality localization services.
                      <br><br>
					  The Importance Of Accurate Arabic Game Localization
						<br><br>
                      The Wrong way: 
In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was released. The first-person shooter game, part of a hugely popular series, was made available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. As part of the storyline and design, there was a map of Pakistan included. The map featured Arabic content while Pakistan’s Official Languages are English and Urdu.
The right way:
In stark contrast, Uncharted 3 was released by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2011 and created with higher cultural awareness in mind. A scene that included an Egyptian character, was portrayed by Egyptian-America actor Sayed Badreya. Not only was the language correct, but the slang and informal usage were also accurate. Sony went on to release Uncharted 4 in 2016, along with a fully localized version for Arabic.
These two examples illustrate the one real challenge tied to any Localization project: know your audience. The 2009 Call of Duty may not have been released for a Pakistani audience specifically, but even when the game isn’t completely localized for one specific audience, every language, culture, and country used within the game should be respected.
Let’s expand further on what makes the Arabic language unique, and why it requires specific expertise and local knowledge to get it right.

                      <br><br>
					  Cultural And Religious Sensitivities
					<br><br>
                      With its immersive qualities and varied characters and landscapes, games are made to be enjoyed. A big part of this lies in the correct application of cultural values and norms that exist in your target locale.
Let’s look at Happy Farm as an example. The hugely popular Social Network game and massively multiplayer online game simulating farm management has its most active player base in Asia.
Happy Farm also reached a high number of players in Arabic-speaking countries because the successfully localized Arabic version took the local culture into account and doesn’t feature pigs, since Muslims do not raise them.

                      <br><br>
						RTL-Languages And Video Game Localization
                      <br><br>
					  
					  Arabic is written from right-to-left (RTL) rather than the left-to-right (LTR) format used in English. In this often technically challenging situation, the main roadblocks lie in the visual translations related to page layout and user interface.
						<br><br>
						Text Expansion
                      <br><br>
					  A further technical challenge lies in the fact that Arabic text will take up more space than the English one, causing a potential minefield of bugs and issues when not managed correctly. On average, Arabic translations take up 25 percent more space, and when translated to English the text can contract between 20 and 25 percent. 
A tech-savvy localizer will make use of a suitable Translation (CAT) Tool and use it to specify the maximum characters’ length or limitations for each segment that will be translated into your target language(s). Setting up these target lengths prevents common Text Expansion errors.
                      <br><br>     
						Conclusion					  
					  <br><br>
					  Arabic Game Localization can be a huge opportunity to introduce your games into the fastest growing online market. But it needs to be done effectively so your audience will connect with your product in a genuine way. This involves linguistic, cultural, as well as technical considerations that all need to be applied accurately.

                    <p class="blogContentMobile d-md-none">I know you all probably know what all these terms mean, but the definitions I found for translation, localization, internationalization and transcreation were very interesting. The first three terms were taken from Wikipedia, but transcreation did not exist on Wikipedia yet, also that interesting. They are all very dear terms to me, so here you go:
                      <br><br>
                      Translation is the comprehension of the meaning of a text and the subsequent production of an equivalent text, likewise called a “translation,” that communicates the same message in another language. The text that is translated is called the source text, and the language that it is translated into is called the target language. The product is sometimes called the target text.
                      <br><br>
                      Translation, when practiced by relatively bilingual individuals but especially when by persons with limited proficiency in one or both languages, involves a risk of spilling-over of idioms and usages from the source language into the target language. On the other hand, inter-linguistic spillages have also served the useful purpose of importing calques and loanwords from a source language into a target language that had previously lacked a concept or a convenient expression for the concept. Translators and interpreters have thus played an important role in the evolution of languages and cultures.[1]
                      However, localization and internationalization is not separated, which I think they should be. Here is the joint definition:
                      <br><br>
                      In computing, internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different languages and regional differences. Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.
                      <br><br>
                      Internationalization readies your product for global markets and ensures it can be localized easily. It is the designing and re-engineering of a product so that it can be localize easily for global markets. It is important to complete internationalization before localization begins; otherwise, you may need to reengineer your product in parallel with localization.
                      <br><br>
                      Transcreation: Adaptation, mainly used in drama contexts, is defined as “
                      the ‘freest’ form of translation” and one where “… the SL [source language] culture [is] converted to the TL [target language] culture and the text rewritten” (p. 46).The idea of rewriting a text to adapt it to the norms of the target culture, to the point that little trace is left of its source, seems to be at the root of transcreation, too. Nowadays often used in advertising and the media, transcreation is a portmanteau word made by combining together translation and creation, in order to emphasise the considerable amount of creativity required in the process.
