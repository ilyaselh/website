                    <p class="blogContentPc d-none d-md-block">Localization to another market isn’t very easy, and if done improperly, can be dangerous to your bottom line. This is especially true for translation. SDL International found that “eight out of 10 international businesses lose revenue, delay product launches, or pay fines for non-compliance because of translation errors.” We’re guessing that’s a majority you don’t want to be a part of when you are going global.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">The Challenges of Going Global</span><br><br>
                      There are many obstacles standing between your business and international success. Here are three of the trickiest:
                      <br><br><span class="blogSubTitle">Cultural Differences:</span> <br><br>People’s beliefs and preferences differ widely from culture to culture. For example, some societies prefer online shopping and others dislike buying anything without face-to-face contact. Payment method preferences also vary widely. While Japan feels safer making use of credit cards online, Germans often opt for bank wire transfers and direct debit. Before entering a new market, take time to research all the nuances of the people within it.
                      <br><br><span class="blogSubTitle">Differences in Communication Styles:</span><br><br> The issues of communicating with international customers go far beyond language differences. Things like displaying dates, body languages, and color preferences also play a part in making a product launch successful. Learn everything you can about a country’s communication style before launching that advertising campaign.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">The Complexity of Law and Logistics:</span> <br><br>Tariffs, duties, shipping prices, and tax laws can make stark difference to your firm’s finances. Not learning about them beforehand can also leave your company on the wrong side of an orange jumpsuit. Consult with a legal professional in your target market before finalizing any expansion plans.
                      Not handling these challenges effectively can land your company in a pot of hot water.
