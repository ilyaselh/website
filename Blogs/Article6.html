              </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    <p class="blogContentPc d-none d-md-block">If you want to tap into the Arabic market, you’ll first need to earn their attention.
                      Breaking into new markets isn’t just about having in-demand products or filling a need. Rather, much of your success will depend on how you adapt your company to their market.
                      Despite over a third of internet users being non-native English speakers, studies from Forrester Research show that website visitors will stay on a website longer if the content is in their native language.
                      Localization is the practice of making your website fit within a unique market. The language of the content, the images of the people, pop culture references, or common symbols can all provide the sense that your website was made with an audience in mind.
                      Take a look at four reasons your business should consider Arabic localization for your content marketing:
                      <br><br><span class="blogSubTitle">1. Localization Increases Sales</span><br><br>
                      User language preferences have been studied at length. The resulting figures indicate that 90% of users will opt for a website version in their native tongue, regardless of whether or not they speak English.
                      Even more telling? A whopping 42% of users say they will NEVER do business with a company if the content isn’t in their native language.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">2. Localization Offers a Competitive Advantage</span><br><br>
                      Despite the benefits of Arabic localization, your competitors may be failing to capitalize on them. When you employ content localization, it gives you an obvious advantage over businesses trying to compete for your market but have yet to adapt their content.
                      And if your competitors DO have a localized website, they’re likely the ones to earn the business if you do not. You can upgrade your own content marketing to encroach on their market share.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">3. Localization Offers a Native Appeal</span><br><br>
                      Some companies are so thorough and effective at localization that it’s something of a shock to find out they’re not actually based in your home country.
                      The more you can blend with your target country’s culture, from imagery to linguistics to the arts and more, the better chance you stand of seeming like you belong in their business world.
                      <br><br> <span class="blogSubTitle">4. Localization Strengthens Your Global Presence</span><br><br>
                      Even if you’re only doing business in the U.S. localization can put you in a position of <a href="article7.html" class="blogInnerLink">global prominence</a>. It’s not easy taking a business across borders, but investing in localization shows that you have the business acumen to adapt to a new market.
                      
                      What To Do Next
                      Using my translation services can help ensure that your content is properly adapted to the Arabic market. Rather than approaching translation word for word, I take into account the way people talk and integrate language with culture to produce the desired results.
